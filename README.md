# CS-490-h-index-PageRank-HITS

This is the repository for the RnD project I took up in my 5th semester.

It includes a literature review of h-index and its alternatives , Page Rank Algorithm , Hubs and Authorities paper by John Klienberg

It includes implementations of PageRank Algorithm and Hubs and Authorities paper in context of citation graph of papers and authors to find the most prominent papers and researchers in a field

Implementations folder contains the data scraping code , Page Rank algorithm implementation and Authoritative Sources in a Hyperlinked Environment paper implementation

The files including the implementations:

1. PageRank.ipynb   :     Includes standard Page Rank algorithm
2. PageRank_TemporalFairness.ipynb  :  Includes Temporal fairness in page rank
3.  HubsAndAuthorities_Papers.ipynb : standard HITS on Papers graph
4.  HubsAndAuthorities_Authors.ipynb : standard HITS on Authors graph
5.  HubsAndAuthorities_Authors_TemporalFairness.ipynb  : Temporal fairness in HITS on authors graph
6.  HubsAndAuthorities_Papers_TemporalFairness.ipynb  : Temporal fairness in HITS on papers graph
